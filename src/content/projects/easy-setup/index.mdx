Developed Pet Link as part of a team of engineers. Pet Link solves the problem of pet illnesses going
unnoticed. Pet owners and log and make posts of any behaviors or symptoms their pet may have.
Users can see other posts that have been marked as public, and they can search for other pets near
them and with the help of the HERE API, they can see a map with pinpoints of other pets’ locations.
