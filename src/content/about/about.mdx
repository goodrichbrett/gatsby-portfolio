As a developer with a passion for learning and applying my skills, I leverage my experience working in a warehouse to excel in fast-paced environments by meeting deadlines. My education in computer networking helps me be more knowledgeable and aware about development and internet standards. Passionate about piecing together computer hardware and evolving through never ending learning. Applying my skills is my main motivator. I am seeking a software engineering / full stack developer position where dependability is valued.
